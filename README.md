#  Interactive Dynamics for Physics Simulations

This is a test made for the [Constraint Based Simulator](https://github.com/EmmanuelMess/ConstraintBasedSimulator). It provides a constraint satisfaction physics simulator with automatic differentiation.

## Math for a single particle

This explanation is meant to complement the references, please read that first. This explains
how to compute the derivates with respect to time and position.

$C_p(t)$ is a constraint function on a set of particles $p$ so that:

$$ \exists t / C_p(t) = 0 \land \exists \dot{C_p} $$

To obtain the constraint as a function of particles positions (instead of time) we use:

$$ \widetilde{C}_p(x(t)) = C_p(t) $$

We don't have the single particle $x(t)$ function analitically, but we can use an approximation (a Taylor approximation at $t = 0$):

$$ \widetilde{C}_p(\widetilde{x}(t)) \approx C_p(t) $$

$$ \widetilde{x}(t) = x + t * v + \frac{1}{2} * t^2 * a \approx x(t) $$

$$ \widetilde{x}(0) = x_t \land \dot{\widetilde{x}}(0) = v_t \land \ddot{\widetilde{x}}(0) = a_t $$

And that lets us compute the derivatives ($p_i \in p$ and $C^i$ is a constraint):

$$ C = \begin{bmatrix} C^0(0) & \cdots & C^m(0) \end{bmatrix}^T $$

$$ \dot{C} = \begin{bmatrix} 
 \frac{\partial C^0} {\partial t}(0) & \cdots & \frac{\partial C^m} {\partial t}(0)
\end{bmatrix}^T
$$

$$
J = \begin{bmatrix}
  \frac{\partial C_ {p_0}^0}{\partial x_1} & \frac{\partial C_ {p_0}^0}{\partial x_2} & \cdots & \frac{\partial C_ {p_n}^0}{\partial x_1} & \frac{\partial C_ {p_n}^0}{\partial x_2}  \\
  \vdots & & \vdots & & \vdots \\
  \frac{\partial C_ {p_0}^m}{\partial x_1} & \frac{\partial C_ {p_0}^m}{\partial x_2} & \cdots & \frac{\partial C_ {p_n}^m}{\partial x_1} & \frac{\partial C_ {p_n}^m}{\partial x_2}  \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

$$
\dot{J} = \begin{bmatrix}
  \frac{\partial \dot{C}_ {p_0}}{\partial x_1} & \frac{\partial \dot{C}_ {p_0}}{\partial x_2} & \cdots & \frac{\partial \dot{C}_ {p_n}}{\partial x_1} & \frac{\partial \dot{C}_ {p_n}}{\partial x_2}  \\
  \vdots & & \vdots & & \vdots \\
  \frac{\partial \dot{C}_ {p_0}}{\partial x_1} & \frac{\partial \dot{C}_ {p_0}}{\partial x_2} & \cdots & \frac{\partial \dot{C}_ {p_n}}{\partial x_1} & \frac{\partial \dot{C}_ {p_n}}{\partial x_2}  \\
\end{bmatrix}
$$

With these we can compute Î» such that:

$$
(J W J^T) {\lambda}^T + \dot{J} \dot{\widetilde{x}} + J W \ddot{\widetilde{x}} + k_s C + k_d \dot{C} = 0
$$

We compute using an approximate least squares method.
